_About Wall-E_


WALL- E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth-Class, with the formal designation N. 62675) is the titular protagonist of the 2008 Disney/Pixar animated feature film of the same name. He is a waste-collector drone created by the Buy n Large corporation initially programmed to haul the garbage plaguing Earth in the distant future. Unexpectedly, his years of loneliness and never-ending work allowed him to gain a consciousness of his own, and a wish for something else in life to come. One day, his world is turned upside-down when he meets another robot from outer space.

Wall-E is my favorite movie since I was a child. This movie taught me a good lesson.
